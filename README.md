# Kaggle projects

This repository contains notebooks from Kaggle datasets I've worked on:

1. Distinguishing bees from wasps (https://www.kaggle.com/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp).

2. Sentiment analysis for IMDB movie reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
