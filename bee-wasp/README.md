# Introduction

This is a minor learning project for gaining familiarity with PyTorch. 

The project is an analysis of the following data set about distinguishing bees from wasps:

# Outline

* First steps: imports and downloading the data set.

* Data processing: import labels, collect indecies, import the images, normalize the data.

* Convolutional neural network: train a NN with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.


# Next steps

* Use a GPU to improve results.

* Add Dropout and Batch Normalization to the CNN.
